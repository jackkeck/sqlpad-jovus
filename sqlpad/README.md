# SQLPad

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickbergfalk/sqlpad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rickbergfalk/sqlpad)

A web app for writing and running SQL queries and visualizing the results. Supports Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, Crate, Vertica, Presto, and SAP HANA. Other databases potentially supported via [unix odbc support](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad/wiki/ODBC).

## Installation, Usage, Screenshots

## Using Docker Image

The docker image runs on port 3000 and uses `/var/lib/sqlpad` for the embedded database directory.

Some configuration is exposed via environment variables. See [configItems.js](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad/blob/master/server/lib/config/configItems.js) for details on environment variables considered (`envVar` field).

See [docker-validation](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad/tree/master/docker-validation) folder for example docker-compose setup with SQL Server.

## Building

- Clone/download this repo
- Install node 10 or later ([nvm recommended](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- Ensure you have the latest npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm -g
  ```

- Install dependencies and build the UI

  ```sh
  scripts/build.sh
  ```

At this point you can run the SQLPad server with the frontend built for production use:

```sh
cd server
node server.js --dir ../db --port 3010 --base-url '/sqlpad'
```

If prefered, SQLPad can be installed as a global module using the local files in this repo. This allows running SQLPad via the cli in any directory, just as if you had installed it with `npm install sqlpad -g`

```sh
cd server
node install -g

# Now from somewhere else you can run sqlpad like
cd ~
sqlpad --dir ../db --port 3010 --base-url '/sqlpad'
```

A docker image may be built using the Dockerfile located in `server` directory. See `docker-publish.sh` for example docker build command.

## Development

- Clone/download this repo
- Install node 8 or later ([nvm recommended](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
- Ensure you have the latest npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm -g
  ```

- Install dependencies and build the UI

  ```sh
  scripts/build.sh
  ```

- Open 2 terminal sessions in the root of this repo.

  In one install the backend dependencies and start the development server

  ```sh
  npm start --prefix server
  ```

  In the other install frontend dependencies and start the development server

  ```sh
  npm start --prefix client
  ```

At this point you should have both backend and frontend development servers running.

http://localhost:3000 serves React-based frontend in dev-mode  
http://localhost:3010 serves frontend compiled for production

When viewing the frontend in development mode, the page will automatically refresh on frontend file change. The backend server will auto-restart on backend file change.

ESLint and Prettier are used to enforce code patterns and formatting in this project. A precommit hook should enforce and warn about these checks. If that is not set up however you may find these terminal commands useful.

```sh
# To check lint
npm run lint

# To fix (some) errors and formatting automatically
npm run fixlint
```

### Mock driver

When SQLPad server is run in debug mode, a mock driver implementation is available to generate data. The data returned by the query run is determined by information parsed from the comment block. The rest of the query may be anything.

Measure fields will contain random data.

```sql
-- At least one dimension field is required. MUST include number of unique values
-- orderdate and orderdatetime should not be used at same time
-- dimensions = department 10, color 10, product 10, orderdate|orderdatetime 500

-- Optional measures
-- measures = cost, revenue, profit

-- Optional order by. MUST be a dimension or measure returned and MUST include direction
-- orderby = department asc, product desc

-- Optional limit
-- limit = 100
